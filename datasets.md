# Datasets

Relevant to Condition Monitoring of machines,
but possibly going outside of this.

## Machine conditions

[NASA Prognostics Data Repository](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository).
Collection of datasets for operational and failed systems. Thermal, vibration, electronical

## General outlier detection

* [Outlier Detection DataSets (ODDS)](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/).
Huge number of datasets.
In multiple groups:
Multi-dimensional point,
time-series point (uni/multivariate),
time-series graph data,
adverserial/attack data,
* Numenta Anomaly Benchmark [NAB](https://github.com/numenta/NAB).
50+ different time-series, benchmarked on many methods.
* [UCSD Anomaly Detection Dataset](http://svcl.ucsd.edu/projects/anomaly/dataset.htm).
Video of pedestrian walkway. Anomalies are non-pedestrians.
A subset has pixel-level masks.
