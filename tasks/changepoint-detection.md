# Change point detection

Change point detection.
In Time series, at which point something changes.
Often growth rate. Can also be amplitude.
Changes in distribution.

Breakout detection.
In time series, when the mean shifts relatively suddenly.
Mean divergence/shift. Or transition too/from (rampup).

## Usecases

* Condition Monitoring of machines
* Network Intrusion Detection (IDS)

## Software

* [banpei](https://github.com/tsurubee/banpei).
Change-point detection using Singular Spectrum Transform (SST),
Outlier detection using Hotelling's theory.
