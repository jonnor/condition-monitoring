## Hidden Markov Model-Based Methods in Condition Monitoring of Machinery Systems
Omid Geramifard, 2013

HMM is one of the commonly used approaches to perform tool wear monitoring for
various machining processes such as
grinding [41], milling [33, 42, 43, 44, 45], drilling
[37], turning [46, 47].
The cutting tool wear monitoring and prediction of useful life were modeled using
hidden Markov model (HMM) and continuous HMM [33, 34, 35,37, 36].

Used acceleration, acoustic emission and spindle power.

For a particular drilling condition (tool, spindle speed and depth of hole),
we have a well-defined process during normal operation.
- The spindle power ramps up steadily as the drill bit makes contact with the work-piece.
- Followed by a steady (or slightly decreasing) phase of initial drilling
- Followed by a gradual increase to peak power where the drill-bit passes through the plate and is removed
- Finally there is a ramp down followed by a low power phase during the period of retraction

For a normal run, these phases all take place at a similar time during the drilling process,
as the timing for each run is roughly constant.
This motivates an automated method for determining the hidden states by performing
time-labelling of the data.
The beginning and end of each drill run was labeled,
by placing markers on the beginning of the ramp up to full power and the ramp down to constant.
Added normalised time as a fifth variable in the feature vectors, and cluster the composite feature vectors using PCA into 2d.
The temporal pattern is clearly seen in 2d.
